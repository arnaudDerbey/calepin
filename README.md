## ‚ö†Ô∏è Work in progress

Edytor is currently in the early stages of development. It is not yet ready for production use.
I welcome early contributors to help us build a better editor for Svelte.
Just run it, see what you can do with it, and open issues or PRs.

If you want to submit an issue please share the json value of the document. It will help understand and fix the issue.

## ‚ú® Features

- üìë **Customizable with snippets**: Use snippets to render your own blocks and marks
- üé® **Rich Text Formatting**: Full support for marks, blocks and inline blocks.
- ü§ù **Real-time Collaboration**: Uses Y.js as data store, collaborative editing is built-in
- üîå **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for custom features. I try to make every action performed by the editor hackable and preventable to let you build your own features.
- ‚ö° **High Performance**: Optimized for large documents, fine grained update at the leaf level thanks to Y.js and Svelte's reactivity
- üîÑ **Undo/Redo**: Built-in history management
- üì¶ **Lightweight**: Relatively small bundle size compared to other rich text editors
- üì¶ **AI copilot ready**: Support inline text suggestions for ai completions.

- [ ] Children transformation
- [ ] Block suggestions
- [ ] Reactive data (inline)block properties with syncrostate.

## üß† Concepts

Edytor structure is built around this key concepts:

- **Blocks**: Container elements like paragraphs, headings, and lists
- **Content**: The content of a block is an array of inlines blocks or text and marks.
- **Children**: Children are the blocks that are directly inside a block. They allow an infinite nesting.
- **Marks**: Texts are simply text with marks that define the formatting.
- **Inline blocks**: Inline blocks are inline elements that are no editable and render custom components like footnotes, equations, etc.

Example of a document:

```jsx
<document>
	<block>
		<content>
			<text mark="bold">Hello</text>
			<text>World</text>
			<inline-block  type="footnote">
				<!-- Inline block are rendered by the user code -->
			</inline-block>
		</content>
		<children>
			<block>
				<content>
					<text>World</text>
				</content>
			</block>
			<block>
				<content>
					<text>World</text>
				</content>
				<children>
					<block>
						<content>
							<text>World</text>
						</content>
					</block>
				</children>
			</block>
		</children>
	</block>
</document>
```

### Blocks

Blocks are the container elements like paragraphs, headings, and lists.
They have a content that is an array of inlines blocks or text.
They have children that is an array of blocks.
Blocks can be nested unless they are void or inside an island

An island is a block that is editable but is structuraly stable and isolated from the rest of the document.
It is impossible to merge an island with another block. It is also impossible to move another block inside an island.
You may think of an island as a block that is editable but is not completely part of the document structure and isolated from the rest of the document.

A void block is a block which does not have children or whose children are not editable and rendered outside of the edytor core logic.
Void blocks can render and edit their content anyway. That is usefull to render caption.
You may think of a void block as a block that is completely independent from the rest of the document.
Void blocks acts also like an island but are even less editables.

###

### Inlines

Inlines are the inline elements like bold, italic, and links.
They have a content property that is an array of text.
They have a type property that is a string that identifies the inline type.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install edytor
# or
yarn add edytor
# or
pnpm add edytor
```

### Basic Usage

```svelte
<script>
	import { Edytor } from 'edytor';

	let value = {
		children: [
			{
				type: 'paragraph',
				content: [{ text: 'Hello, World!' }]
			}
		]
	};

	function onChange(newValue) {
		console.log('Document changed:', newValue);
	}
</script>

<Edytor {value} {onChange} />
```

## Testing

I've implemented a custom jsx parser to test the editor.

So instead of defining the value as a json object, you can define the value as a jsx element.

```jsx
<root>
	<paragraph>Hello, World!</paragraph>
</root>
```

I've also implemented the `createTestEdytor` that help with creating an edytor instance from a jsx element in order to test various operations on a virtual edytor.

You can also add one or two cursors with the `|` character into the jsx in order to simulate the cursor position

```jsx
<root>
	<paragraph>Hello, |World!|</paragraph>
</root>
```

```jsx
test('split text', () => {
	const { edytor, expect } = createTestEdytor(
		<root>
			<paragraph>Hello, |World!</paragraph>
		</root>
	);

	edytor.selection.state.startBlock?.splitBlock({
		index: edytor.selection.state.yStart,
		text: edytor.selection.state.startBlock?.firstText
	});

	expect(
		<root>
			<paragraph>Hello, </paragraph>
			<paragraph>World!</paragraph>
		</root>
	);
});
```
